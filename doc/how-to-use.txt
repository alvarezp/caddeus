How to use the caddeus GNUmakefile
===============================


STEP 1: The most simple run.

1. Place all your units in the same directory as the caddeus GNUmakefile.

2. Edit the caddeus GNUmakefile:
   - Set the APP to the application binary name. Ex: APP = myapplication
   - List your units in the OBJS variable. Ex: OBJS = unitname1.o unitname2.o
   - List your libraries (if any) in LIBS. Ex: LIBS = -lm -lpthread

3. Run make.

Your project should build but note that the defaults are really aggressive
and will fail if GCC detects the slightest mistake. Also note that if you
already have clang and cppcheck installed it will try to use them to search
for more errors. Use the CFLAGS variable to remove -pedantic-errors,
-Werror and tweak -std=c99 to -std=gnu99 as you see fit.

If you want to bypass the use of cppcheck invoke make like this:

SKIP_CPPCHECK=1 make

or set SKIP_CPPCHECK=1 at the top of the GNUmakefile.

Same goes for clang:

SKIP_CLANG=1 make

Note that if you have a file called "RELEASE" in the same directory as the
caddeus GNUmakefile, both cppcheck and clang will be skipped.


STEP 2: Add a unit test.

1. Create the directory tests and under it create a directory named after
   your unit. If you have a unit called unitname.c create the directory
   tests/unitname.

2. Create a test file called tests/unitname/testid.t.c. Observe the ".t.c"
   suffix. the "testid" is not currently used for anything in particular.
   You can use any name you want. The test file should have a main() function
   and return 0 if the case succeded or whatever else if the test failed.
 
3. If your unit test requires some library to be declared during compilation
   list them in the variable unitname/testid_TEST_LIBS. Example:
   unitname/testid_TEST_LIBS=-lm -lpthread -lX11
   
4. Run make.

Your unit test will run after the object binary and before the application
binary. Notice that if you invoke "make" again your test will not run. It will
only run if you change your source code.

All the rules regarding cppcheck and clang in the section "STEP 1" apply.

Additionaly, if you have Valgrind installed it will be used against your unit
test file to find memory leaks. You can bypass Valgrind check by invoking make
like this:

SKIP_VALGRIND=1 make

or by setting SKIP_VALGRIND=1 at the top of the GNUmakefile.

Note that if you have a file called "RELEASE" in the same directory as the
caddeus GNUmakefile, Valgrind will be skipped but the unit test will still be
called.


STEP 3: Add an application test

1. Create the directory tests.

2. Create a test file called tests/testid.tt. Observe the ".tt" suffix. This
   file should already be executable and perform whatever code you want to
   run after building your application binary. It should return 0 if the test
   succeeded or whatever else if the test failed.
   
3. Run make.

Your test will run after the application binary was built. Notice that if you
invoke "make" again your test will not run. It will only run if the
application binary changed.

Your test will not be run against Valgrind.

You may also use the ".t.c" suffix for application tests instead of ".tt" by
placing the test directly under the tests/ directory. The same rules as for
unit tests apply.

Tweaks:

If there is a RELEASE file, cppcheck, valgrind and clang will be skipped.
